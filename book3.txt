give me a small story not similar to above


The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, lived a solitary life on the craggy cliff. His only companions were the screeching gulls and the rhythmic whoosh of the lamp turning. One blustery evening, a tiny, injured bird fluttered against the glass. Silas gently brought it inside, its wing bent at an awkward angle. He fashioned a splint from a twig and fed it crumbs of his meager dinner. Days turned into weeks, and the little bird, whom Silas named Spark, grew stronger. Finally, the day came when Spark perched on Silas's finger, chirped a cheerful tune, and soared out into the vast, open sky. Silas smiled, a warmth spreading through his chest that the lonely lamp had never quite provided. He was alone again, but the memory of Spark's brief visit filled the silence with a quiet joy.
